Implementations of the [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game))
game in various zero knowledge circuit languages/

These implementations were produced in a "hackathon" style, so they may contain a wide variety of flaws.
The point of these implementations was not to produce flawless and well-optimized code, but rather to
give the developers a taste of how the languages are to work in.

# ZK Mastermind Examples

This repository contains implementations of the [Mastermind](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)>)
game in various zero knowledge (ZK) circuit languages and frameworks.

## Repository Structure

We have implemented this game in the following languages, with each implementation residing in a separate directory.
Each directory contains a small README detailing the structure of the implementation and basic usage instructions:

- Arkworks (`arkworks/`)
- Circom (`circom/`)
- Gnark (`gnark/`)
- Halo2 (`halo2/`)
- Noir (`noir`)
- Lurk (`lurk`)
- O1js (`o1js`)

## Disclaimer

These implementations were produced in a "hackathon" style, so they may contain some errors or be poorly optimized.
The point of these implementations was not to produce flawless and well-optimized code, but rather to
give the developers a taste of implementing a project in a variety of languages and frameworks.
